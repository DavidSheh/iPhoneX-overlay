# iPhone X Overlay
This is a simple editor utility which masks the game view in such a way to emulate the rounded corners of the iPhone X's screen and to present the home bar in the correct location for use when working on ui layout and level design. The goals of this project are:

* simplicity, no use interaction should be needed to use this asset, just install it and go!
* stability, this asset should cause no interference with any other asset.
* predictability, it's behavior should be easy to understand and function reliably
* usability, it should disappear from the mind of the user such that it is simply useful and not a hinderance
